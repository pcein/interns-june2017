Week2 of Internship
======================

This week, you can proceed in one of two ways:

a)

Students from branches other than CS/IT, and those who
are going a bit slow, can continue with the Think Python
book:

http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html

For a first attempt, you can skip those exercise which might
take a lot of time to complete. But please make sure that you 
do all the simpler exercises. Put up all the code you write
on github.

               

b) CS/IT students should complete the "Google Python Class" Exercises:


https://developers.google.com/edu/python/

You should go through the notes on the above site and complete a set of
4 "Python Exercises" (basic, baby names, copy special, log puzzle).

The exercise solution files should be put up on github.

Please post on the mailing list as you finish each of the four exercises.

------

I hope all of you are posting daily updates to your github repo as instructed
during the beginning of the internship.
