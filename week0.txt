0) Understand how to use a few very basic Linux commands like
pwd, cd, cat, ls, mkdir:

https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html

1) Download the following .iso file:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/eezunyomx895br4/rl100-screencasts-final.iso?dl=0  

(it is around 172Mb in size)

2) Learn how to access the files inside this .iso file by doing what is
called a "loopback mount" on Linux:

https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/how-to-mount-iso-image-under-linux.html 

You will see a folder called "rl100" inside this .iso file once you do 
a loopback mount. There will be folders like "cmdline", "commands" etc
under "rl100". You can navigate to each folder using the "cd" and "cd .."
commands. Each of these folders contain a few .mp4 files - these are
some screencasts I have created for teaching basic usage of the Linux operating
system.

3) Watch the following screencasts (in the order specified) and experiment with the
commands on your system. Please understand that passive watching IS NOT sufficient.
You have to actively try out everything.
(note: the screencasts are a few years old ... the graphical user interface you
see there may not match the one that you have on your system. But that is irrelevant -
as far as a programmer is concerned, the GUI is of little value ... the commandline
is all that matters!).

(*.mp4 means all the mp4 files)

rl100/vim/vim.mp4   (you might have to install "vim" first: sudo apt-get install vim)
rl100/cmdline/*.mp4
rl100/commands/*.mp4
rl100/director/director.mp4 
rl100/compilat/compile.mp4
rl100/gdb/gdb1.mp4 (optional - gdb is a tool used for debugging C programs - you 
                    may skip this video if you find it hard to understand - but please
                    give it a try)

rl100/shellbas/shellbas.mp4 (optional - more information regarding the "shell" - the 
                             "shell" is the program running within your terminal which reads
                             the commands you type and executes them on your behalf - you may
                             skip it if you find it too complicated - but please give it a try).

4) Download the following and untar it:

http://pramode.net/downloads/git.tgz

5) Read and work out all the commands in "git1.pdf" which you
get by untarring the above .tgz file.

6) Watch 

rl100/gitbasic/gitbasic.mp4

(note: git is a *very* complex tool; don't worry if you find things to be
a bit tricky. Just get a broad understanding, that is sufficient)

7) Create a free account on github.com (note: use a good "id" when you create
the account; you can use your name+year-of-birth or something of that sort. Your
github id is almost as important as your email id)

github.com is a web site which hosts git repositories for free; if you have 
a project and if you want others to contribute to it, you can keep the source
code of your project in a git repository on github.com and other people will
be able to access your code and do collaborative development. 

8) Learn how to use github.com by watching:

rl100/github/*.mp4 (note: these are old screencasts - the github user interface
                    might have changed significantly - you can find out by experimenting
                   on your own)

9) Start learning Python programming basics by reading and working out exercises in
the following book:

http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html

You can skip the "case study" chapters. For the first week (June 1st to 7th), you
need to finish the chapters up till and including "files".

10) People who are completely new to programming: if you find the above book
a bit difficult, you can read and work out the example code/exercises in this
book:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/c2s10e6jehx18c2/pylatex.pdf?dl=0 

(it is a pdf document)

(Chapters 1 to 13, skip chapters 4, 5).
