You will focus 100% on basic Python programming this week.

Please continue with your study of:

You can continue from "Classes and objects" to "Debugging". The case
study chapter can be skipped.

If there is sufficient time left, you should cover the chapter on 
"Analysis of algorithms" also.


Note: Some of the exercises in the book are challenging; you can skip
them if you wish. But make sure you do the simpler exercises. The only
way to learn a programming language is by reading and writing code.
