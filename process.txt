This note explains how you should go about doing the 
internship.

---

You should create a directory (folder) called "internship" in
your system.

Every day, you should create a text file inside this folder. On
June 1st, you will create a file called:

june1.txt


This text file should contain a brief (say 4-5 sentence) description
of  what all things you studied as part of the internship on that
day.

If you were not able to do anything on that day, DO NOT create the
text file.

As soon as you have studied the basics of git/github, convert this
folder ("internship") to a git repo (by doing a "git init") and add
and commit all the files in the folder. You should then create a 
repository called "internship" on github and push the contents of your
local git repo ("internship") to the remote repository.

From now onwards, whenever you add a new file to the local repo, always
synchronize with the github repo by pushing to it.
