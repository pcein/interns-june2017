This exercise is designed to improve your ability to work on the 
command line on a Linux system. You will have to do some research 
and learn some things independently to find out the solutions.

Please complete on or before 14th June 2017.

Read the instructions below carefully.

--------
a) Using the "ssh" command, log on to the 
following remote system:

IP address:  128.199.116.252

user name: guest
password: cpython1234


b) The actual questions for this test are stored in
a file called:

qns.txt

on the remote system.  You will have to find out where 
this file is located (hint: the "find" command)

c) Create a directory (under /home/guest which is your
login directory) - the name of the directory
should match your name; for example:

cd /home/guest  
mkdir arjun

(make sure this name doesn't conflict with any other directory
names already present; if so, change the name, say call it 
arjun1996 or something like that)   

d) All the answers to the test questions should be
found out by running commands on the remote system.
The answers should be stored in a file called "ans.txt"
under the folder which you have created (say "arjun").


e) It will be necessary to create some files as part of the
solution to some of the test questions. ALL files you create
should be under the folder which you have created. As all of
you are working under the same login("guest"), unless you work under
different folders, it will create a lot of confusion.


f) Please do not hesitate to post questions on the mailing list if
you get confused by any of these instructions.

g) Please do NOT collaborate with your friends for finding out
answers to the questions. The only intention behind these questions
is to make you do some research independently. Do not miss out on
that experience!
