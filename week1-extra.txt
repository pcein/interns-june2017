Extra task for week1
=======================

This is a chance for you to earn some bonus points!

Here is the task:

The Python programming language (more specifically, the standard
Python implementation called "cpython") is written in C. You can
think of Python as a really large and complex C program!

Here is the source code of python version 2.7.13:

https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.13/Python-2.7.13.tgz

Download it to your machine and try looking at some of the C source
files.

Now, see if you can compile this large and complex C program and build
your own copy of Python!

(Google is your friend. Ask for stuff like "how to build python from source")

If you are able to do this, create a git repo called "python-from-source" and
store a file called README in this repo which briefly explains the steps you took
to build python from source. 

And don't forget to post a message to the group!

More bonus points
==================

(This is TOUGH)

Having access to the source code of an application gives you the power to
change it to suit your requirements.

Can you make some trivial change to the Python programming language by
modifying its C source?

I will be *very* happy if some of you are able to do this ... don't forget
to post to the mailing list!
